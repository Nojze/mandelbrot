# Mandelbrot set
Dive into the world of mathematics with this programming project that re-creates the stunning patterns of the Mandelbrot set. Using my knowledge of discrete mathematics and complex numbers, I brought this intricate fractal to life with the help of C# and Windows Forms .NET. A true testament to the beauty and power of mathematics.

## Important to Note
The project includes Swedish commentary explaining the code's functionality. Understanding may be difficult without prior knowledge of the Mandelbrot set.

Unfortunately, this project shows only the first set of the Mandelbrot set, it does not zoom infinitely into the set similar to [those on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M7dTmvJxwA&ab_channel=KarimESSAIFI).

## Built With

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - IDE used to develop the program
- [C#, Windows Forms .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) â€“ Programming language
