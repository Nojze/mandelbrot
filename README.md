# Mandelbrot set
A math programming project where I re-create the pattern of a Mandelbrot set using the knowledge I had in discrete mathematics and complex numbers.

## What to know
The project contains Swedish comments describing what is going on through the code, it can be hard to understand what is going on without the knowledge of how the Mandelbrot set works. 

Unfortunately, this project shows only the first set of the Mandelbrot set, it does not zoom infinitely into the set similar to [those on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M7dTmvJxwA&ab_channel=KarimESSAIFI).

## Built With

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - IDE used to develop the program
- [C#, Windows Forms .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) â€“ Programming language
